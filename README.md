==========

Jason Pluger's lame circuit

###Analysis
My waveform did not match my original truth table. However, after further
analysis I realized I had interpreted the B_NOT gate incorrectly and
therfore revised my original results to be consistent with the waveform.


**Truth Table**

Oh bother, I'm upside down...
...and I don't know how to fix myself
